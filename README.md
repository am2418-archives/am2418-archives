# AmazingMech2418 Archives
**Note:** I know GitHub profile READMEs don't currently work for organizations, but this is still meant to provide some information about this organization's purpose and statistics.


## Purpose
This organization is one run by [AmazingMech2418](https://github.com/AmazingMech2418) to archive old projects that I do not plan to work on anymore at least for now. 

This organization likely will not have any repositories updated, but serves as almost a time capsule of some of my old abandoned projects. If you would like to fork these repositories to update them, feel free, but make sure to give me some credit! Many of these do have the MIT license which does require copyright notice, and I would like that all of the unlicensed repositories be considered to have the same license, rather than for me to keep my complete ownership rights.
